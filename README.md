**Ecological Impact Assessment repository**

This repository contains all of the components necessary to determine my results for this assessment 

**EIAtaxonomyGBIF** : code used to check the north hillside invert results against GBIF taxonomy backbone; I did it for this sheet, and other members of the group did it for the other sheets, and these were compiled in a shared dataset 

**Arran Fielcourse** : raw data as uploaded to the shared excel sheet by each member of the group 

**arran_res.xslx** :  raw data edited in the way i wanted to format it for results, with GBIF taxonomy from shared dataset applied; I changed the formatting of some sheets for my analysis (combined all vertebrates, combined all terrestrial inverts and aquatic inverts etc)

**EIA_Results.R** : script containing all code used for analysis
